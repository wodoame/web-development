Elements with `visibility: hidden` are still in the document flow. This means they occupy space on the page, but they are not visible to the user. The element's layout and dimensions are preserved, and it affects the positioning of other elements around it.

In contrast, elements with `display: none` are completely removed from the document flow, meaning they do not occupy any space and do not affect the layout of other elements.

Here's a quick example to illustrate the difference:

```html
<div class="visible">Visible Element</div>
<div class="hidden">Hidden Element</div>
<div class="visible">Another Visible Element</div>
```

```css
.hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

In this example, the "Hidden Element" will not be visible, but it will still take up space between the two "Visible Element" divs.
