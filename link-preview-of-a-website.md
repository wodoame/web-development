To make a link to your website have previews on platforms like WhatsApp, you can use Open Graph meta tags. These tags provide metadata about your webpage, including information such as the title, description, and image that should be displayed when the link is shared. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Add Open Graph Meta Tags to Your HTML:**
   Include the following meta tags in the `<head>` section of your HTML document. Adjust the content attribute values to match the relevant information for your website.

   ```html
   <head>
       <meta property="og:title" content="Your Website Title">
       <meta property="og:description" content="Brief description of your website">
       <meta property="og:image" content="URL to the image you want to display">
       <meta property="og:url" content="URL of your website">
       <!-- Add other relevant Open Graph tags as needed -->
   </head>
   ```

   Replace "Your Website Title," "Brief description of your website," and "URL to the image you want to display" with the actual title, description, and image URL for your website. Ensure that the image URL is an absolute URL.

2. **Verify Your Markup:**
   Validate your HTML markup to ensure that the Open Graph meta tags are correctly implemented. You can use online tools like the Facebook Sharing Debugger (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) to check how your link will appear when shared.

3. **Testing:**
   After adding the Open Graph meta tags, share your website link on WhatsApp to see the preview. If you don't see the desired information or image, use the debugging tool to identify any issues.

By incorporating Open Graph meta tags into your website's HTML, you provide platforms like WhatsApp with the necessary information to generate accurate and appealing link previews. Keep in mind that changes might not be immediately reflected, and it may take some time for platforms to update their caches.
