The `autocomplete` attribute in HTML is used to control whether a browser should automatically complete a form field based on the user's input history. It is typically applied to `<form>` elements or specific form fields such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.

The `autocomplete` attribute can take one of three values:

1. **on**: This is the default value. It allows the browser to automatically complete the form field based on the user's input history.

    ```html
    <form autocomplete="on">
        <!-- form fields go here -->
    </form>
    ```

2. **off**: This value disables autocomplete for the entire form or a specific form field. If you want to disable autocomplete for a specific field, you can apply the attribute to the individual input element.

    ```html
    <form autocomplete="off">
        <!-- form fields go here -->
    </form>
    ```

    or

    ```html
    <input type="text" name="username" autocomplete="off">
    ```

3. **new-password**: This value is used specifically for password fields, indicating that the browser should not autocomplete with previously saved passwords.

    ```html
    <input type="password" name="password" autocomplete="new-password">
    ```

Using the `autocomplete` attribute can be helpful in situations where you want to provide a better user experience or enhance security by controlling the autocomplete behavior of form fields. However, keep in mind that some browsers may not fully support or respect the `autocomplete` attribute, and users can also configure their browser settings to override it.
