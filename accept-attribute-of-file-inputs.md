The `accept` attribute in HTML is used with the `<input>` element of type "file" to specify the types of files that a user can pick through the file input dialog box. It helps in filtering the files displayed in the dialog, allowing the user to select only files of certain types.

Here's how you can use the `accept` attribute:

```html
<input type="file" accept="image/*">
```

In this example, the `accept` attribute is set to "image/*". This means that the file input will only allow the selection of image files. The "*" is a wildcard character that matches any file type within the "image" category. You can specify different MIME types or file extensions based on your requirements.

Examples:

- To allow only JPEG images:
  ```html
  <input type="file" accept="image/jpeg">
  ```

- To allow both JPEG and PNG images:
  ```html
  <input type="file" accept="image/jpeg, image/png">
  ```

- To allow any type of text file:
  ```html
  <input type="file" accept="text/*">
  ```

It's important to note that the `accept` attribute is a hint to the browser, and the actual file filtering is done by the browser's file dialog. Some browsers may not support or enforce the `accept` attribute, so it's always a good practice to validate the file type on the server side as well.

Keep in mind that users can still manually select files of any type, so the `accept` attribute is mainly a user interface enhancement rather than a strict security measure.
