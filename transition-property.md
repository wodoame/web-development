The `transition` property in CSS allows you to smoothly animate the changes in property values. It provides a way to control the speed and timing of the transition between two states of an element. Transitions can be applied to various properties such as `color`, `background`, `width`, `height`, and more.

Here's the basic syntax of the `transition` property:

```css
selector {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}
```

- **property:** Specifies the CSS property you want to apply the transition to. This can be a single property (e.g., `background-color`) or the keyword `all` to apply the transition to all properties.

- **duration:** Specifies the duration of the transition. It can be specified in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).

- **timing-function:** Defines the timing curve for the transition. It determines how intermediate values are calculated between the starting and ending values. Common values include `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`.

- **delay:** Optional. Specifies a delay before the transition starts. It can also be specified in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).

Here's an example:

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  transition: width 1s ease-in-out 0.5s;
}

.box:hover {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

In this example, when you hover over the element with the class `box`, the `width` property will transition from its initial value to the new value over a duration of 1 second, with an ease-in-out timing function, and a delay of 0.5 seconds.

Transitions are often used for creating smooth effects like hover transitions, fade-ins, and more. They provide a more visually appealing and interactive experience for users. It's worth noting that not all properties can be smoothly animated using transitions; some require the more powerful `animation` property for complex animations.

Additionally, the `transition` property can be shorthand, allowing you to specify multiple properties and their individual durations, timing functions, and delays in a more concise manner.
