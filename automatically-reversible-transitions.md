 **CSS transitions** behave differently for certain properties. The reason for this behavior lies in how transitions work and how the browser interprets the **initial**, **final**, and **intermediate** states of the property being transitioned.

### How Transitions Work:
A CSS transition involves specifying a starting state and an ending state, then animating the change over a defined duration. The **transition** happens from one state to another, but if you only define a transition in one direction (e.g., from `state A` to `state B`), the reverse transition (from `state B` back to `state A`) doesn’t automatically occur unless explicitly defined.

### Properties That Automatically Transition Both Ways
Some properties are designed to work in both directions without needing an explicit reverse transition. For these properties, **CSS** can interpolate both ways because the browser has a clear understanding of the starting and ending values. Examples of these properties include:

- **`opacity`**: Transitioning from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1` (or vice versa) works automatically because opacity is simply a scalar value (between `0` and `1`).
  
- **`transform`**: You can transition between different `transform` states (like `scale()`, `rotate()`, `translate()`, etc.) both ways because the browser can calculate the intermediate steps.

- **`background-color`**: Transitions smoothly from one color to another, so the reverse transition can also work naturally.

For example:
```css
button {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover {
  opacity: 0;
}
```
When you remove the `hover`, it will naturally go back to `opacity: 1`.

### Properties That Do Not Transition Both Ways Automatically
For other properties, the **reverse** transition might not happen unless explicitly defined because the intermediate values might not be interpolatable in a smooth way. These include properties like:

- **`height`**, **`width`**: Transitioning a `height` or `width` from `auto` to a specific value is tricky, and the reverse transition may not always work as expected without defining explicit values.

- **`display`**: A `display` change (e.g., from `display: none` to `display: block`) is not transitioned because it's a discrete change—one value is either set or not, and it cannot be animated over time.

- **`visibility`**: A `visibility` change (from `visibility: hidden` to `visibility: visible`) is typically **not** transitioned because it doesn’t have a range of values—it's a binary state.

- **`position`**: Transitioning a `position` value (e.g., `absolute` to `relative`) doesn’t work well because it represents a layout change rather than a visual interpolation.

For example:
```css
div {
  height: 100px;
  transition: height 0.3s ease;
}

div:hover {
  height: 200px;
}
```
If you want to reverse it, you might need to set an explicit value for the height when you hover off (e.g., `height: 100px;`), because the browser can't interpolate the reverse automatically.

### Key Point: The Nature of the Property
- **Interpolatable properties** (like colors, opacity, and transforms) are more likely to transition smoothly in both directions because they have defined **intermediate states**.
- **Discrete or layout-related properties** (like `display`, `height`, `width`, `position`, etc.) do not naturally transition both ways. They are either **instant** changes (like `display`) or difficult to interpolate, so a reverse transition may not work smoothly unless explicitly handled.

### What Can You Do?
- For **layout properties** like `height`, `width`, or `position`, you'll need to define both the **starting** and **ending** states clearly in your transition.
- You can handle transitions between `auto` values by transitioning to a fixed value first, or using JavaScript to adjust the values dynamically based on the current state.
