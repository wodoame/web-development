<!-- In HTML, you can create a multiple select box (also known as a multi-select dropdown or list) using the `<select>` element with the `multiple` attribute.
This allows users to select multiple options from a list of available choices. Here's an example of how to create a multiple select box: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Multiple Select Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Select your favorite fruits:</h2>
    <form action="process_form.php" method="post">
        <select name="fruits[]" multiple>
            <option value="apple">Apple</option>
            <option value="banana">Banana</option>
            <option value="cherry">Cherry</option>
            <option value="orange">Orange</option>
            <option value="strawberry">Strawberry</option>
        </select>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In the example above:

- We use the `<select>` element to create the select box.
- We add the `multiple` attribute to indicate that this select box should allow multiple selections.
- The `name` attribute on the `<select>` element is set to "fruits[]" to collect multiple selected values as an array in the form submission.
-->

<!-- When the user holds down the Ctrl key (or Cmd key on Mac) and clicks on the options, they can select multiple items.
The selected items are submitted as an array in the form when the user submits it.
In your server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, or Django), you can process the form data to access the selected values as an array. 
For example, in PHP, you can use `$_POST['fruits']` to access an array of selected fruit values.
In django we can access the array of selected fruit values by using request.POST.get('fruits')
