The `white-space` property in CSS controls how whitespace inside an element is handled. Here are the main values for the `white-space` property:

1. **normal:**
   - Sequences of whitespace are collapsed.
   - Text wraps as necessary.
   - Breaks are allowed as determined by automatic wrapping.

2. **nowrap:**
   - Sequences of whitespace are collapsed.
   - Text does not wrap, and any overflow is clipped.

3. **pre:**
   - Whitespace is preserved.
   - Lines are only broken at newline characters (`\n`) and `<br>` elements.
   - Text does not wrap automatically.

4. **pre-wrap:**
   - Whitespace is preserved.
   - Lines are broken at newline characters (`\n`) and `<br>` elements.
   - Text wraps as necessary.

5. **pre-line:**
   - Whitespace is collapsed.
   - Lines are broken at newline characters (`\n`) and `<br>` elements.
   - Text wraps as necessary.

6. **break-spaces:**
   - Whitespace is preserved.
   - Text is broken at whitespace characters, including spaces.
   - Lines are broken at newline characters (`\n`) and `<br>` elements.
   - Text wraps as necessary.

The `white-space` property is useful for controlling how text content behaves within an element. Depending on your specific use case, you can choose the value that best suits your formatting requirements.
