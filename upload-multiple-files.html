To upload multiple files in a web application, you can use HTML and JavaScript. The HTML input element with the `type="file"` attribute allows users to select files for upload. You can use JavaScript to handle the selected files and perform the upload to a server. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a multiple file upload feature:

<!-- 1. Create the HTML form: -->

   <form id="file-upload-form" enctype="multipart/form-data">
     <input type="file" id="file-input" multiple>
     <button type="submit" id="upload-button">Upload Files</button>
   </form>
   <ul id="file-list"></ul>

<!-- The `multiple` attribute in the file input allows users to select multiple files. -->

<!-- 2. Create a JavaScript function to handle the file selection and display the selected files: -->
  
<script>
   const fileInput = document.getElementById('file-input');
   const fileList = document.getElementById('file-list');
   fileInput.addEventListener('change', function () {
         // you can access a list of file object by doing: 
         fileInput.files
        // To make working a little easier we can contruct an array from file list
        // We would like to display the names of the files in the html for now 
        Array.from(fileInput.files, (file) =>{
          fileList.innerHTML += `<li>${file.name}</li>`; // file object has a property called name which is the name of the file
        })
         }
   });
 </script>

<!-- The above code listens for changes in the file input, reads the selected files, and displays their names in an unordered list. -->

<!-- 3. Create a JavaScript function to handle the file upload when the form is submitted: -->
  <script>
   const uploadForm = document.getElementById('file-upload-form');
   const uploadButton = document.getElementById('upload-button');

   uploadForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
     event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission
     const formData = new FormData(uploadForm);

     // You can now send the formData to a server using XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API, or a library like Axios.
     // Example using the Fetch API:
     fetch('/upload-endpoint', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: formData,
     })
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => {
         // Handle the server's response here
       })
       .catch(error => {
         // Handle errors
       });
   });
  </script>

<!--
In this code, when the form is submitted, it prevents the default form submission, creates a `FormData` object containing the selected files, 
and then sends the data to a server using the Fetch API. 
Replace `'/upload-endpoint'` with the actual URL where you want to handle file uploads on your server. -->

<!-- 4. Handle file uploads on the server-side. The server-side code will depend on the technology you are using (e.g., Node.js with Express, PHP, Python, etc.). 
You need to write code to receive and process the uploaded files. -->

<!-- Remember to set up appropriate server-side handling for file uploads, including validation, storage, and security measures.
The specific server-side implementation will vary depending on your server technology. -->

<!-- This example provides the front-end code to handle multiple file uploads in a web application. 
The back-end server code will differ based on your server platform and requirements. -->
