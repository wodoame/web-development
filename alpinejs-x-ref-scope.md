In Alpine.js, the `x-ref` directive respects the scope in which it is defined. This means that if you have two different elements with the same `x-ref` (e.g., `x-ref="text"`) but they are defined in different `x-data` scopes, each `x-ref` will reference the element within its own scope.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this:

```html
<div x-data="{ message: 'Hello from first scope' }">
    <span x-ref="text">{{ message }}</span>
    <button @click="console.log($refs.text.innerText)">Log First Scope Text</button>
</div>

<div x-data="{ message: 'Hello from second scope' }">
    <span x-ref="text">{{ message }}</span>
    <button @click="console.log($refs.text.innerText)">Log Second Scope Text</button>
</div>
```

In this example, clicking the button in the first `x-data` scope will log "Hello from first scope", while clicking the button in the second `x-data` scope will log "Hello from second scope". Each `x-ref="text"` is scoped to its respective `x-data` component²³.

This scoping behavior ensures that `x-ref` references are unique within their own component, preventing conflicts and making it easier to manage DOM elements within complex applications.
