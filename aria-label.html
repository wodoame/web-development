<!-- The **aria-label** attribute in HTML is used to provide an accessible name or label for an element that does not have an inherent label 
or that needs a more descriptive label than its content provides¹. This attribute can be used with any element that 
accepts the aria-label attribute¹. For example, consider a button element that contains an icon or image, but no text. Without a 
label, a screen reader user may not know what the button does. In this case, the aria-label attribute can be used to provide an accessible name for the button that describes its purpose¹. Here's an example:
 -->
<button aria-label="Play video">
  <i class="fas fa-play"></i>
</button>

<!-- In this example, the button element contains a font-awesome icon of a play button, but no text.
The aria-label attribute is used to provide an accessible name for the button that describes its purpose to screen reader users¹.

Another example is an input element with a search icon. Without a label, a screen reader user may not 
know what the search input field is for. In this case, the aria-label attribute can be used to provide an accessible name 
for the input field that describes its purpose¹. Here's an example:
 -->
<label for="search-input" class="visually-hidden">Search</label>
<input type="text" id="search-input" aria-label="Search">
<!-- 
In this example, the label element is used to provide a hidden accessible name for the input field that describes its purpose. 
The aria-label attribute is used as a fallback in case the label element is not read by the screen reader¹.

In summary, the **aria-label** attribute is used to provide an accessible name or label for an element that does not have 
an inherent label or that needs a more descriptive label than its content provides¹. This attribute is important for making web
content accessible to users with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers¹³.

I hope this clarifies the use of **aria-label**. Let me know if you have any other questions!
