Local Storage in JavaScript refers to the `localStorage` object, which is part of the Web Storage API. It provides a way for web applications to store key/value pairs locally within a user's browser. The data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the user closes the browser or navigates away from the page. It's a simple form of client-side storage that can be used for various purposes, such as caching, preferences, or maintaining state between page reloads.

Here's a brief overview of `localStorage`:

1. **Key-Value Storage:**
   - `localStorage` stores data as key-value pairs. Both the keys and values are strings.

2. **Persistence:**
   - Data stored in `localStorage` persists across browser sessions and page reloads. It is stored indefinitely until explicitly removed by the web application or cleared by the user.

3. **Storage Limit:**
   - The amount of data that can be stored in `localStorage` varies by browser, but it is typically around 5 MB. It's important to note that this storage is per domain, meaning each website has its own `localStorage`.

Now, regarding the possibility of multiple instances of `localStorage`:

- **Per Domain:**
  - Each domain (or website) has its own isolated `localStorage`. This means that if you have two different websites open in two different tabs, each website has its own `localStorage`, and changes in one do not affect the other.

- **Per Protocol and Port:**
  - The separation is also based on the protocol (http/https) and port number. For example, `http://example.com` and `https://example.com` would have separate `localStorage` instances.

- **Per Browser:**
  - `localStorage` is specific to the browser and is not shared between different browsers on the same device.

- **Per Window/Tab:**
  - Each window or tab within a browser has access to the same `localStorage` for a given domain. This means that if you open a new tab or window for the same website, they share the same `localStorage`.

- **Per Origin:**
  - The term "origin" refers to the combination of protocol, domain, and port. If any of these components differs, the `localStorage` is considered different.

It's important to be aware of the scoping rules of `localStorage` to avoid unexpected behavior in your web applications. If you need to share data between different tabs or windows, you might consider other techniques, such as using the `sessionStorage` (which has a shorter lifespan and is tab-specific) or exploring other methods like using cookies or server-side storage.
